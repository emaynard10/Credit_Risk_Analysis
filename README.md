# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using supervised machine learning to predict credit risk
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the analysis uses oversampling with the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampling using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, using a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling it applies the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, it compares two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
#### Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Python, supervised machine learning algorithms
#### Resources: LendingClub credit card data LoanStats_2019Q1.csv.zip

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
